# Portfolio

## Process of Creating and Building My Portfolio

1. Brainstorm ideal layout and create a wireframe
   To start, I brainstormed how I want the site to look. I knew I wanted sections for Home, About, Project, and Contact. I was going to put these all on one single page, but then decided to put them on their own seperate page. I then drew out a very rough looking draft of the wireframe. Some of the things I wanted were a Navigation Bar on each page, clickable logos, and highlighted text when hovered over.
2. Figure out which elements to create in HTML and jQuery
   When I first came up with the wireframe I was trying to decide what I should create in HTML and jQuery. I later decided I would put all of the elements in the HTML so my Javascript file wouldn't be so long. This would make it more readable and managable in th future. For all of the animations and `.on()` interactions, I created those in jQuery.
3. Brainstorm the functionalities I want to add
   For me Brainstorming 3 different types of interactions was kind of difficult. I of course used the `.on()` and `.hover()`, which is deprecated and replaced with `.on('mouseenter')` and `.on('mouseleave)`, but figuring out the third interaction was tough for me. I then talked with my instructor Matt and he came up with a cool idea to `.toggle()` the project description.
4. Create the HTML
5. Style page with CSS
6. Add Javascript and jQuery
7. Make responsive to all devices

## Problems encountered
